# buildpack-tater

This is a dead-simple buildpack (compatible with platforms that use buildpacks, like heroku or [Datica](https://datica.com). For an example application, have a look at [forana/buildpack-tater-example](https://github.com/forana/buildpack-tater-example).

## What it does

Using this buildpack completely ignores your application and overwrites your `Procfile` to serve a picture of our dog instead.

## Why?

BECAUSE LOOK AT HIM
